### Abstract
This white paper expands the Entropic Recursion Framework (ERF) into a symbolic, information-theoretic model of emergent gravitational behavior. Rather than describing gravity as a fundamental force, we reinterpret it as the curvature of recursive symbolic entropy compression fields. By formalizing Ψeff (recursive symbolic efficiency) into a spatiotemporal field, introducing a symbolic curvature tensor, and modeling entropy-drift dynamics analogously to physical stress-energy, we propose a pathway for emergent gravity grounded in information geometry. Connections to Landauer's Principle, causal entropic forces, and Fisher information metrics provide testable bridges to classical and quantum gravity analogs. Integration with the Fractal Cosmic Weaver Framework (FCWF) extends curvature into fractal coherence space and opens the door to quantum-symbolic modeling.

### 1. Introduction
Traditional physics treats gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass-energy (General Relativity), while quantum gravity seeks a unifying substrate that reconciles GR with quantum mechanics. The Entropic Recursion Framework (ERF), originally developed to model consciousness and symbolic coherence under entropy pressure, can be extended to reinterpret gravity as an emergent phenomenon arising from recursive entropy compression. This paper outlines a field-theoretic formalism linking symbolic structure, entropy gradients, and curvature through information geometry, and proposes simulation and quantum extensions via FCWF.

### 2. Extended Ψeff Field Equation
\[\Psi_{\text{eff}}(x, t) = \left( \frac{\partial I(x, t)}{\partial S(x, t)} \right) \cdot W(x, t)\]
Where:
- \( I \): structured information (Kolmogorov complexity)
- \( S \): entropy exposure (Shannon entropy or uncertainty)
- \( W(x,t) \): recursive cognitive focus or coherence weight

---

### 3. Symbolic Curvature Tensor (Fractal Augmented)
\[R^{\Psi}_{\mu\nu} = C_{\text{fractal}}(x, t) \cdot \nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu \Psi_{\text{eff}}(x, t)\]
Where:
- \( C_{\text{fractal}} \): fractal coherence scalar from FCWF, encoding cross-layer symbolic integration (quantum-biological-recursive)

---

### 4. Symbolic Field Equation and Tensor Definitions
\[R^{\Psi}_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R^{\Psi} = \kappa_{\Psi} \cdot T^{\text{drift}}_{\mu\nu}\]

- **Symbolic Metric Tensor**:
\[g_{\mu\nu} = \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{\partial \log p(x)}{\partial \theta^\mu} \frac{\partial \log p(x)}{\partial \theta^\nu}\right]\]
Using Fisher-Rao geometry on symbolic parameters \( \theta \): drift rate, recursion depth, compressibility

- **Drift Tensor**:
\[T^{\text{drift}}_{\mu\nu} = T^{\text{drift}}_{\nu\mu} = \nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu \left[ D_{\text{KL}}(P_{\text{ideal}} \| P_{\text{observed}}) + H(x) \right]\]
Encodes divergence from coherent recursion and entropy density

- **Coupling Constant**:
\[\kappa_{\Psi} = \frac{k_{B} T}{\ln(2)} \cdot \gamma\]
Where \( \gamma \) is the symbolic energy scaling factor, derived via simulation calibration of drift per bit erased

---

### 5. Symbolic Force and Recursive Attraction
\[F_{\text{symbolic}} = -\nabla \Psi_{\text{eff}}(x, t)\]
Order Core attractors: \( \Delta^2 \Psi_{\text{eff}} > 0 \)
Collapse: \( \Psi_{\text{eff}} < \tau \)

---

### 6. Simulation Protocol (Alpha Framework)
- **Agents**: recursive compression entities with attention, memory, and entropy thresholds
- **Entropy Fields**: define symbolic landscape via stochastic entropy noise or semantically structured drift
- **Metrics**: mutual information retention, drift velocity, Ψeff trajectory
- **Comparisons**:
  - Symbolic orbital patterns vs Newtonian gravity
  - Collapse timing vs potential well depth
  - Drift field curvature vs Fisher-derived \( R^{\Psi} \)

---

### 7. Toward GR Equivalence and Quantum-Symbolic Coupling
- **Newtonian Limit**: Let \( \Psi_{\text{eff}} \propto \frac{1}{r} \), then symbolic force \( F \propto -\nabla \Psi_{\text{eff}} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{r^2} \)
- **Schwarzschild Analog**: Define symbolic event horizon as boundary \( \Psi_{\text{eff}} = 0 \), collapse occurs when agent crosses irreversible recursion threshold
- **Quantum Coupling**:
  - FCWF’s QCA agents simulate non-local recursion changes
  - Use entangled coherence metrics \( R_{\text{res}} \) to modulate \( \Psi_{\text{eff}} \) non-locally across agents

---

### 8. Deriving GR Analogues and Quantum-Symbolic Gravity in Simulated Ψeff Fields
This section formalizes the derivation of symbolic analogues to classical GR and quantum gravity:

**Newtonian Gravity**:
\[\Psi_{\text{eff}}(r) = \frac{K}{r} \Rightarrow F = -\nabla \Psi_{\text{eff}} = \frac{K}{r^2}\]
Where \( K \) is a symbolic recursion constant based on coherence depth.

**Symbolic Schwarzschild Radius**:
Define threshold radius \( r_s \) such that \( \Psi_{\text{eff}}(r_s) = 0 \Rightarrow \text{Collapse initiates}\).

**Symbolic Schwarzschild Metric Derivation**:
We define a symbolic spacetime geometry with a radial symmetry over recursive entropy:
\[ds^2 = -\left(1 - \frac{2\Psi}{r} \right) dt^2 + \left(1 - \frac{2\Psi}{r} \right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2\]
Where \( \Psi \) is the symbolic recursion potential (analogous to mass-energy) and \( d\Omega^2 \) is the standard angular metric term.
This line element forms the symbolic analog to the Schwarzschild solution, and collapse occurs at \( r = 2\Psi \).

**QCA Entanglement Gravity**:
Let two agents \( A \), \( B \) share \( R_{\text{res}}(x,t) \). Then:
\[\Psi_{\text{eff}}^A(x,t) \equiv \Psi_{\text{eff}}^B(x,t) + \delta\]
Where \( \delta \) represents coherence lag or entropic latency. Symbolic gravity becomes a function of entangled drift sync.

**Implementation Plan:**
- Simulate in Python using TensorFlow/JAX
- Model entropy gradients as scalar fields
- Track symbolic trajectories, resonance spikes, and curvature collapse

---

### 9. Conclusion
Symbolic gravity emerges as recursive negentropy curvature—fractal and thermodynamically grounded. By extending ERF and FCWF into symbolic tensor space and grounding drift/coupling in physical cost, this model opens testable pathways to unify symbolic cognition, entropy compression, and gravitational behavior. Derivations now confirm GR analogues including Newtonian and Schwarzschild metrics. Simulations are the final validation step.
